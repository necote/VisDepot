# Creating a Data Visualization Toolkit 

To start developing a data visualization toolkit beyond data analysis/wrangling (i.e. the [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/), Excel, Python, or R) you might also want to consider tools for static prototyping and/or drawing as well as those various tools and libraries for visualization. Taking on more than one tool may seem like a lot for those starting out, but it can help avoid becoming too dependent on any one technology or resource. 

This section will connect you with a few tools you might consider using for your next visualization project.

**Note:** "Traditional" in the below refers to tools for making the standard charts many think of, i.e. bar charts, line charts, pie charts & etc. "Creative" in the below refers to tools that  particularly lend themselves to forms outside of those "traditional" chart styles. "Coding" versus "Non-Coding" in the below refers to whether or not you will need to know how to code to use that tool. 

## Traditional, Non-Coding  
- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), Excel (not free), or Google Sheets can allow for the generation of simple charts. 
- [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) is a tool for creating network graphs. **Note:** the Gephi site includes free [tutorials](https://gephi.org/users/). 
- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) (free for students) is a popular drag-and-drop style data visualization tool. **Note:** if you are not a student or employed somewhere that pays for a corporate Tableau package this can become costly. 
- [RAWGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) is a great alternative to Tableau, and is built on top of D3.JS and the visualizations can be later edited with a tool like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). **Note:** the RAWGraphs site includes free [tutorials](https://rawgraphs.io/learning).
- [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/overview) allows you to create simple data visualization dashboards.

## Creative, Non-Coding 
- Pen and Paper! See the "Making a Case for Data Sketching, Analog Visualization, and Prototyping" if you need to be convinced about hand-drawn work. 
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or Adobe Illustrator (not free) **Note:** those using Illustrator might also be interested in [ai2html](http://ai2html.org/) for converting Illustrator files into HTML & CSS.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or Adobe Photoshop (not free) 

## Traditional, Coding Required 
- Python [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/#), [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)   
- R [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
- [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and/or [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) These tools are built on top of D3.JS, which makes them look like the graphics that many are familiar with. Vega-Lite is useful for producing traditional visualizations that require little personalization. Vega has a bit more breadth in terms of options.  **Note:** the Vega site includes free [tutorials](https://vega.github.io/vega/tutorials/).   
- [D3.JS](https://d3js.org/)

## Creative, Coding Required 
- [P5.JS](https://p5js.org/)
- [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) for 3D graphics 

## Read Further
- Andy Kirk's [collection](https://www.visualisingdata.com/resources/) of visualization tools might be the most extensive list there is; however it might be an overwhelming list to peruse for those just starting out. 
- Jon Olav H. Eikenes' article ["Designing a Custom Data Visualisation"](https://medium.com/nightingale/designing-a-custom-data-visualisation-433e50908459) speaks usefully to using a ranging data visualization toolkit (R, Illustrator, and P5.JS) to create a visualization. 
- **Note:** I have provided additional materials on many of the above tools in the Additional Resources section in order to avoid cluttering this page.
