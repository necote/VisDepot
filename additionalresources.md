# Additional Resources

This section offers additional technical, conceptual, and social data/visualization resources, as well as a round-up of material previously shared in the various Read Further sections of this guide. This is nowhere near a complete resource, but a basic guide for getting your feet wet! If there are any free/open tutorials (that you find particularly successful/easy to understand for beginners), readings, or projects that might be useful to include please do reach out.
