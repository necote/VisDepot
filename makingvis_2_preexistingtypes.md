# Choosing an Existing Vis-Type 

This section will offer a few resources to help you determine the "traditional" chart type that might work best for your project. 

- [The Data Visualization Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) offers an overview of different chart types to help you choose which is best for your needs, and allows for sorting types by function (i.e. part-to-whole relationships, hierarchies, & etc.).
- [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) is another great chart-selecting resource that can be filtered by need. A particular strength of this site is the [Caveats](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html) page which attempts to dispel visualization related rumors and speak to common visualization pitfalls. 
- [The Chartmaker Directory](https://chartmaker.visualisingdata.com/) is limited/non-exhaustive but helpful way to source tutorials if you are just exploring *and* already know the kind of chat you want to make, but might not yet know which tool you want to use. It shows the particular tutorials a given tool has for a particular chart. What is unclear is if/how often this resource is updated.    
- The ["Design Elements and Principles"](https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/) article on Canva Learn's blog is not necessarily specific to data visualization, and doesn't pretend to be the most comprehensive design principles list, but it can offer a quick overview of design considerations such as negative space, texture, and scale, transparency, & etc. Considering even basic design principles might be helpful for raising concerns and/or critiquing your visualization or considering potential ways forward for your work.
