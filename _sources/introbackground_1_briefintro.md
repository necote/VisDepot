# A Brief Introduction to Working with Data and Spreadsheets 

This section offers a curated list of existing tutorials for starting to work with data generally, and some ways into thinking about spreadsheets in particular. 

- **["What is Data"](https://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/what-is-data/) by School of Data:** A quick and clear beginner’s overview to understanding data types (qualitative and quantitative) and categories (categorical, discreet, and continuous) as well as unstructured versus structured data. 
- **["What is Data / What is Data Literacy"](https://www.emich.edu/library/help/tutorials/assets/data_intro/story_html5.html) by Eastern Michigan University:** A video/slideshow introductory tutorial on defining data and data literacy, identifying data types, and two forms of statistical analysis. It includes a short quiz at the end. Please note: there is some overlap between this tutorial and “What is Data” by School of Data, but I recommend them both if you are new to working with data.
- **["Representing Data"](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-sixth-grade-math/cc-6th-data-statistics/dot-plot/v/ways-to-represent-data) by Khan Academy:** This is a very clear and simple video refresher that shows a few ways to represent the same information (tables, charts, lists, frequency, and range). Please note: whether your data looks like the simple chart from the Khan Academy video or a massive dataset: do keep the same data types in one column.   
- **["Sort and Filter: the Basics of Spreadsheets"](https://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/sort-and-filter/) by School of Data:** A quick textual tutorial on basic spreadsheet skills (navigating, sorting, and filtering) with Google Sheets (though the skills are translatable to other similar formats such as Excel or [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/)). 
- **["Common Misconceptions"](https://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/common-misconceptions/) by School of Data:** Quick textual overview to data and visualization traps and proposed solutions (averages, chart sizes, timelines, correlation and causation, context, % changes, and base rate fallacy).   
- **["Data Provenance"](https://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/data-provenance/) by School of Data:** A short overview on documenting the history, versions, and processing of a dataset including tips and suggested tools (Excel, [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [DataHub](https://datahub.io/)).
