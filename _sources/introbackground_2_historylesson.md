# A Quick History Lesson 

Although now seemingly ubiquitous, the visualization of data is *not* a new practice. The below resources can offer a good place to start for those interested in the history of visualization. 

**[“A Brief History of Data Visualization”](http://datavis.ca/papers/hbook.pdf) by Michael Friendly.** This article by Michael Friendly, an expert in the history of visualization, spans a long time period of data visualization and is both short and comprehensive. 

**[*Data by Design: An Interactive History of Data Visualization*](http://dataxdesign.io/) by Lauren F. Klein.** This will be a new online project documenting the history of data visualization to be released in the Fall of 2021. 

**[“A Timeline of Timelines”](https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/13/archibald_rosenberg.php) by Sasha Archibald and Daniel Rosenberg.** A graphic showing the history of timelines. A short write-up on timelines entitled ["The Trouble with Timelines: the Measure of it All"](https://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/13/rosenberg1.php) by Rosenberg is also available.

**[“Why Circles"](https://vimeo.com/232545208) by Manuel Lima:** This is a recording of Manuel Lima’s 2017 *eyeo* talk. It speaks to the long history of using circle diagrams. Note: Lima often researches the history of one form: network, trees (with its own [TedTalk](https://www.ted.com/talks/manuel_lima_a_visual_history_of_human_knowledge)), circles, & etc. His website [*Visual Complexity*](http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/) (and especially the blog) is a good resource for this material, and includes references parts of his books.

- The Library of Congress has [digitized](https://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=%22lot%2011931%22%20NOT%20medal&st=grid&co=anedub&loclr=blogpic) copies of many of W.E.B. Du Bois' data visualizations. While there is no written article by the library alongside the collection, the historical visualizations themselves are fascinating and powerful.
